# My Nixpkgs Overlay

This repository serves as a custom Nixpkgs overlay where my own personal
packages are stored.

## Usage

Do `nix flake show github:drupol/my-nixpkgs` to see the available packages
available.

## Going further

- Use the continuous integration service of your choice to build and test your
  packages
- Add a binary cache to your repository to speed up builds and avoid
  recompilation using [Cachix](https://cachix.org/)
- This project uses a flake framework, we recommend to use [flake-parts](https://flake.parts)

## Contributing

Feel free to contribute by sending pull requests. We are a usually very
responsive team and we will help you going through your pull request from the
beginning to the end.

For some reasons, if you can't contribute to the code and willing to help,
sponsoring is a good, sound and safe way to show us some gratitude for the hours
we invested in this package.
